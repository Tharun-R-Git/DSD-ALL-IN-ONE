      <h3>DIGITAL LOGIC GATES</h3>
        <p>The basic building blocks of electronic circuits are the digital logic gates. They execute various logical operations according to the requirements.
They can take multiple inputs but have only one output, generally.
The combination of various digital logic gates determines the output. Combinations of these gates lead to the formation of Combinational Logic Circuits.
Logic gates use Boolean algebra to execute logical processes.
Logic gates are found in nearly every digital gadget we use on a regular basis. Logic gates are used in the architecture of our telephones, laptops, tablets, and memory devices.

      <h3>TRANSISTOR TRANSISTOR LOGIC</h3>
      <p>Transistor‚Äìtransistor logic (TTL) is a logic family built from bipolar junction transistors. 
The reason behind the name is that transistors perform both the logic function and the amplifying function, as opposed to resistor‚Äìtransistor logic (RTL) and diode‚Äìtransistor logic (DTL).
TTL integrated circuits (ICs) were widely used in applications such as computers, industrial controls, test equipment and instrumentation, consumer electronics, and synthesizers.</p>

      <h3>CMOS LOGIC FAMILY</h3>
      <p>he term CMOS stands for ‚ÄúComplementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor‚Äù. 
Today‚Äôs computer memories, CPUs, and cell phones make use of this technology due to several key advantages. 
This technology makes use of both P channel and N channel semiconductor device
